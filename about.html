    <h2 class="section_title">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row row2">
    <div>
      <h2>In the Deposit section, we have made the following three changes:</h2>
      <p>
•	We have added a provision that, unless prohibited by law, Simmons Bank can charge back the amount of any item which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned due to an allegedly forged, unauthorized or missing endorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error or other problem which, in Simmons Bank's judgment justifies, reversal of credit.<br>
•	We added a provision that Simmons Bank may attempt to collect previously returned items without giving the depositor notice, and it may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond the midnight deadline.<br>
•	We added a provision that explains how Simmons Bank processes a deposit with a discrepancy when the depositor is not present.<br>
</p>
    </div>
     <div>
      <h2>In the Withdrawals section, we have made the following changes:</h2>
      <p>
•	We added the following text to be very clear that just because funds are available, the credit can still be reversed. “An item may be returned after the funds from the deposit of that item are made available for withdrawal. In that case, we will reverse the credit of the item.”<br><br>
•	We also revised the text to provide that the right to require notice before withdrawal from an interest earning account does not apply to a demand deposit.<br>
</p>
    </div>
	   <div>
      <h2>We have made several revisions to the Right to Set-Off section.</h2>
      <p>
•	We eliminated the provision that the debt that is set-off is to the extent of the person or entity's right of withdrawal.<br>
•	We made the following revision to increase clarification:<br>
•	Current text: If the debt arises from a note, “any due and payable debt” includes the total amount of which we are entitled to demand payment under the terms of the note at the time we set off, including any balance the due date for which we properly accelerate under the note.<br>
•	New text: If your debt arises from a promissory note, then the amount of the due and payable debt will be the full amount we have demanded, as entitled under the terms of the note, and this amount may include any portion of the balance for which we have properly accelerated the due date.<br>
</p>
    </div>
     <div>
      <h2>In the Security section, we made the following changes:</h2>
      <p>
•	We added a reference to the use of an account number to issue a fraudulent electronic debit, because this is a common example of fraud.<br><br>
•	We deleted the reference to a remotely created check by a telemarketer because of the ban established by the Telemarketing Sales Rule.<br><br>
•	We also clarified that the paragraph regarding commercially reasonable security procedures does not apply if Regulation E applies. We specified that if Simmons Bank offers a commercially reasonable security procedure and the customer selects another security procedure, the customer is responsible for any payment order accepted pursuant to that security procedure whether it is authorized or not.<br>
